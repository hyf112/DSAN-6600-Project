# DSAN-6600-Project

## Project Overview
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve the accuracy of face mask detection. The model leverages both channel and spatial attention layers to focus selectively on relevant features of the input images, which significantly improves performance over traditional CNNs, especially in challenging scenarios involving face occlusions caused by masks.

## Features
- **CNN Architecture**: Utilizes layers of convolution, max pooling, and batch normalization to extract features.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Implements both channel and spatial attention to enhance feature relevance and model focus.
- **Accuracy Enhancement**: Demonstrated higher accuracy in face mask detection on diverse datasets.
- **Robustness**: Improved generalization across different environmental conditions and mask types.
