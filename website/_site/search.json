    "text": "This research has yielded two notable findings regarding the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nFirstly, a significant variation in COVID-19 infection rates across countries has been observed, with a discernible positive correlation between these rates and the population density of a country. In essence, countries with higher population densities tend to exhibit increased COVID-19 infection rates. While this correlation does not establish causality, it underscores the potential mechanisms of virus transmission, emphasizing that measures such as reducing mass gatherings and maintaining social distancing could be effective in curtailing the spread of the virus.\nSecondly, the deployment of vaccines appears to have influenced the rise in COVID-19 cases, though the connection to mortality rates remains ambiguous. Again, while causality cannot be inferred from this correlation, the association suggests that vaccines play a role in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, providing humanity with a potent tool in combating the pandemic.\n\nThis investigation serves as an initial inquiry into the factors influencing COVID-19’s impact. The constraints of the data and the analytical methods used precluded a more detailed examination, such as employing time-series analysis to assess the specific effects of vaccination on the pandemic’s trajectory.\n\nCOVID-19 has wrought considerable havoc, disrupting our daily lives and leading to the loss of many. However, I am confident that through collective human effort, we will ultimately prevail over this pandemic and emerge better prepared for any future global health crises."

    "text": "Global COVID-19 Infection and Death Rates\nI initially aimed to assess the global impact of COVID-19. Broadly, the infection and mortality rates of a pandemic virus serve as critical metrics in gauging its overall effect. To account for demographic variations across countries, I have opted to evaluate each nation’s COVID-19 infection and mortality rates based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths per million inhabitants.\n\nGlobal Map\n\nInfection Rate\n\n\n    \n    \n         \n         \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\nDeath Rate\n\n\n    \n    \n         \n         \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nBar Plot (By Country)\n\nInfection RateDeath Rate\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_infection_rate &lt;- plot_ly(data = sorted_cases, y = ~location, x = ~total_cases_per_million, type = 'bar', orientation = 'h', name = 'Total Cases per Million', height = 2000, marker = list(color = 'red')) %&gt;%\n  layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Total Cases per Million'), title = 'COVID-19 Total Cases Per Million by Country')\n\nplot_infection_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_death_rate &lt;- plot_ly(data = sorted_deaths, y = ~location, x = ~total_deaths_per_million, type = 'bar', orientation = 'h', name = 'Total Deaths per Million', height = 2000, marker = list(color = 'green')) %&gt;%\n  layout(xaxis = list(title = 'Total Deaths per Million'), title = 'COVID-19 Total Deaths Per Million by Country')\n\nplot_death_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s evident that notable disparities exist in the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 across various countries, attributable to an array of elements. These include the efficacy of public health measures and policies, the extent and accuracy of testing and reporting, the robustness of healthcare systems, demographic nuances such as the population’s age distribution, socioeconomic variables, cultural practices, vaccination uptake, and the emergence of different virus strains. Among these nations, the United States presents a particularly intriguing case. Despite its overall resources and capabilities, it has experienced higher rates of infection and fatalities. This juxtaposition positions the United States as a valuable case for in-depth analysis. Consequently, my forthcoming research will be dedicated to examining the trajectory of COVID-19 in the United States."

A closer examination of the changes in growth rates of these cases and deaths is more insightful, as it can more accurately indicate the effectiveness of various factors, such as temperature fluctuations and vaccination efforts, in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and diminishing its mortality rate.\n\n\nDaily New Confirmed COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US\n\nDaily New CasesDaily New Deaths\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_new_cases &lt;- plot_ly(data = owid_covid_data_us, x = ~date, y = ~new_cases, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = 'New Cases', line = list(color = 'red')) %&gt;%\n                    layout(title = \"Daily new confirmed COVID-19 Cases in the US\", xaxis = list(title = \"Date\"), yaxis = list(title = \"New Cases\"))\n\nplot_new_cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_new_deaths &lt;- plot_ly(data = owid_covid_data_us, x = ~date, y = ~new_deaths, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = 'New Deaths', line = list(color = 'green')) %&gt;%\n                    layout(title = \"Daily new confirmed COVID-19 Deaths in the US\", xaxis = list(title = \"Date\"), yaxis = list(title = \"New Deaths\"))\n\nplot_new_deaths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have noticed pronounced irregularities in the daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States, attributable to several factors:\n\nReporting Delays and Backlogs: Inconsistencies in the timing of reporting and processing new cases can cause substantial daily variations. For instance, when a backlog of cases is reported simultaneously, this leads to an abrupt surge, followed by a noticeable decrease in the subsequent days.\nWeekend and Holiday Reporting Patterns: Testing centers and reporting agencies often operate with reduced staff or close entirely during weekends and holidays. This typically results in fewer cases being reported on these days, followed by a marked increase when these delayed reports are processed and released, generally at the start of the week.\nVariability in Testing Rates: The number of tests conducted can fluctuate, influencing the reported case numbers. For instance, an escalation in testing efforts might result in identifying more cases, whereas constrained testing might not capture the true extent of case numbers.\n\nThese elements contribute to the irregular patterns observed in the daily COVID-19 statistics and underscore the need for looking at longer-term trends rather than focusing solely on day-to-day changes. Therefore, I use a 7-day rolling average to smooth out these irregularities and get a clearer picture of the overall trend.\n\n\nDaily New Confirmed COVID-19 Cases and Deaths (7-day rolling average) in the US\n\nDaily New Cases (7-day rolling average)Daily New Deaths (7-day rolling average)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_new_cases_smoothed &lt;- plot_ly(data = owid_covid_data_us, x = ~date, y = ~new_cases_smoothed, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = '7-Day Smoothed New Cases', line = list(color = 'red')) %&gt;%\n                    layout(title = \"7-Day Smoothed Daily New COVID-19 Cases in the US\", xaxis = list(title = \"Date\"), yaxis = list(title = \"New Cases (7-day rolling average)\"))\n\n# Adding a vertical line to mark the start of vaccination on 2020-12-13\nvaccination_start_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2020-12-13\")\nplot_new_cases_smoothed &lt;- plot_new_cases_smoothed %&gt;%\n  add_segments(x = ~vaccination_start_date, xend = ~vaccination_start_date, \n               y = 0, yend = max(owid_covid_data_us$new_cases_smoothed, na.rm = TRUE),\n               line = list(color = \"blue\", width = 2, dash = \"dash\"),\n               showlegend = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  add_annotations(x = vaccination_start_date, y = max(owid_covid_data_us$new_cases_smoothed, na.rm = TRUE), \n                  text = \"Start of Vaccination\", showarrow = TRUE, \n                  arrowhead = 2, ax = 20, ay = 0)\n\nplot_new_cases_smoothed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_new_deaths_smoothed &lt;- plot_ly(data = owid_covid_data_us, x = ~date, y = ~new_deaths_smoothed, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines', name = '7-Day Smoothed New Deaths', line = list(color = 'green')) %&gt;%\n                    layout(title = \"7-Day Smoothed Daily New COVID-19 Deaths in the US\", xaxis = list(title = \"Date\"), yaxis = list(title = \"New Deaths (7-day rolling average)\"))\n\n# Adding a vertical line to mark the start of vaccination on 2020-12-13\nvaccination_start_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2020-12-13\")\nplot_new_deaths_smoothed &lt;- plot_new_deaths_smoothed %&gt;%\n  add_segments(x = ~vaccination_start_date, xend = ~vaccination_start_date, \n               y = 0, yend = max(owid_covid_data_us$new_deaths_smoothed, na.rm = TRUE),\n               line = list(color = \"blue\", width = 2, dash = \"dash\"),\n               showlegend = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  add_annotations(x = vaccination_start_date, y = max(owid_covid_data_us$new_deaths_smoothed, na.rm = TRUE), \n                  text = \"Start of Vaccination\", showarrow = TRUE, \n                  arrowhead = 2, ax = 20, ay = 0)\n\nplot_new_deaths_smoothed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 7-day smoothed data charts for daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States reveal:\n\nCyclical Variability: The charts exhibit distinct oscillations with successive peaks and troughs, with peaks appearing in early 2021, August 2021, and early 2022, of which the peak in August 2021 should correspond to the delta variant pandemic and the peak in early 2022 corresponds to the Omikron variant pandemic. Notably, the case count surge in January 2022 markedly outstrips other periods. While the corresponding rise in deaths is also conspicuous, it does not mirror the cases’ peak with the same magnitude, which may reflect the difference between the Omicron variant and all previous variants: it is more transmissible, but does not show a higher fatality rate. I noticed that 1 month after vaccination started on December 13, 2020, the number of new daily cases and deaths in the United States began to decline. But whether this decline is an effect of the vaccine is unclear.\nSeasonal Trends: A seasonal trend is discernible, with infection and death rates typically intensifying during the colder months, such as January of both 2021 and 2022, possibly due to increased indoor congregation. Conversely, the months of August and September of each year also witness upticks, albeit less pronounced than the winter surges.\nTemporal Lags Between Cases and Deaths: An observable delay exists between the spikes in new cases and subsequent increases in deaths, aligning with the disease’s trajectory, which includes a period between initial infection, the emergence of severe symptoms, and any resulting fatalities. This lag indicates the time required for a rise in infections to manifest as an uptick in mortality rates.\n\nThe data captured in these charts underscore the pandemic’s intricate dynamics, potentially shaped by factors such as public health measures, behavioral shifts among the populace, and the advent of new viral strains."

    "text": "Data Science Question\nThe impact of COVID-19 has been profound and multi-faceted, affecting nearly every aspect of life globally. Two of the most significant impacts have been on human life and the global economy.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in a tragic loss of life worldwide. Globally, as of 3:52pm CET, 30 November 2023, there have been 772,052,752 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6,985,278 deaths, reported to WHO. This loss has not only been a human tragedy but has also had psychological and social repercussions, affecting the mental health of communities and changing the way people mourn and grieve.\n\nThe pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global economy. To control the spread of the virus, many countries implemented lockdowns and social distancing measures, which led to a dramatic slowdown in economic activities. Key sectors such as travel, hospitality, and retail were particularly hard hit. The economic disruption caused widespread job losses, business closures, and financial strain for individuals and families. Governments around the world have had to inject substantial fiscal stimulus to support their economies, leading to increased national debts.\nOverall, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a defining global crisis of the early 21st century, with its impacts likely to be felt for many years to come. Consequently, I believe that a thorough analysis of the factors affecting COVID-19’s transmission and mortality is imperative. Such an investigation will enhance our comprehension of, and preparedness for, any future global pandemics. By understanding the variables that influence the spread and lethality of such diseases, we can develop more effective strategies to curb their proliferation and minimize fatalities. This proactive approach is vital to safeguard public health and preserve lives."

    "text": "Literature Review\n\nPopulation Density and the Transmission of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has prompted extensive research into factors influencing its spread. A significant area of focus has been the role of population density.\nSy et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive study across U.S. counties, revealing a strong correlation between population density and the basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19. They found that areas with higher population densities experienced greater transmission rates, likely due to increased interpersonal contact. The study identified a critical population density threshold necessary to sustain an outbreak, emphasizing the significance of population density in virus transmission dynamics (Sy et al., 2021).\nIn a study focusing on Turkey, Coşkun et al. (2021) explored the combined effect of population density and wind on COVID-19 spread. They concluded that these factors accounted for a significant portion of the variance in virus transmission. The study highlighted that wind, by increasing air circulation, could exacerbate the spread in denser areas, thus underlining the complex interplay between environmental factors and population density in the pandemic’s trajectory (Coşkun et al., 2021).\nYin et al. (2021) investigated the association between population density and COVID-19 infection rates in both China and the USA. Their findings underscored a positive correlation, particularly in regions with severe outbreaks. The study supported the efficacy of social distancing and travel restrictions, pointing out the critical role of population density in managing the spread of the virus (Yin et al., 2021).\nLastly, Wong and Li (2020) presented a study demonstrating that population density was an effective predictor of cumulative infection cases in U.S. counties. Their research incorporated additional demographic variables, such as the percentages of African Americans and Hispanic-Latinas, finding that while these factors influenced infection rates, the impact of population density remained consistently significant. This study highlighted the necessity of including population density in predictive models for COVID-19 spread (Wong & Li, 2020).\nIn conclusion, these studies collectively underscore the crucial role of population density in the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.\n\n\nVaccination and the Infection/Death Rates of COVID-19\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted unprecedented global efforts in vaccine development and distribution at the same time. As vaccination campaigns roll out worldwide, it becomes crucial to evaluate their impact on reducing infection and mortality rates.\nA study by the BMJ (2023) conducted a comprehensive observational study to assess the public health impact of COVID-19 vaccines across counties in the United States. Using data from December 2020 to December 2021, the study utilized generalized linear mixed models to explore the association between vaccination coverage and the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The study’s findings indicate a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths correlating with increased vaccination coverage, even when accounting for social vulnerability and community mobility (The BMJ, 2023).\nSimilarly, another study published in Scientific Reports (2023) analyzed the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the pandemic’s trajectory in various U.S. states. This study focused on the average treatment effect of vaccination on the growth rates of total cases and hospitalizations. It found that COVID-19 vaccines have significantly slowed the pandemic, with a notable reduction in the number of cases and hospitalizations. This study also explored potential biases and the heterogeneous effects of vaccination across different states, finding no significant differences based on demographic or political factors (Scientific Reports, 2023).\nExpanding the scope to a global perspective, a study indexed in PubMed (2023) analyzed the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on daily cases and deaths worldwide. The study demonstrated that increased vaccination rates are associated with a decrease in new COVID-19 cases and deaths globally. However, it also highlighted the challenges of unequal vaccine distribution across countries, emphasizing the need for fair and accelerated distribution to combat the pandemic effectively (PubMed, 2023).\nCollectively, these studies offer robust evidence of the positive impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns on reducing infection and mortality rates."

    "text": "Population Density and Infection Rates of COVID-19\nPrior visualizations and analyses have revealed substantial global variations in COVID-19 infection rates. To investigate the potential correlation between these rates and population density, it is essential to first analyze the probability distributions of both COVID-19 infection rates (Total cases per million) and population densities across different countries.\n\nDistribution\n\n\nCode\n# Setting up the layout\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\n\n# Histogram for 'total_cases_per_million'\nhist(owid_covid_data_country_clean$total_cases_per_million, main=\"Histogram of Total Cases per Million\", \n     xlab=\"Total Cases per Million\", col=\"lightblue\", border=\"black\")\n\n# Q-Q plot for 'total_cases_per_million'\nqqnorm(owid_covid_data_country_clean$total_cases_per_million)\nqqline(owid_covid_data_country_clean$total_cases_per_million, col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\n\n# Histogram for 'population_density'\nhist(owid_covid_data_country_clean$population_density, main=\"Histogram of Population Density\", \n     xlab=\"Population Density\", col=\"lightgreen\", border=\"black\")\n\n# Q-Q plot for 'population_density'\nqqnorm(owid_covid_data_country_clean$population_density)\nqqline(owid_covid_data_country_clean$population_density, col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram of total cases per million is right-skewed, indicating that a majority of the data points are on the lower side of the scale, with fewer countries having very high total cases per million. The histogram of population density shows a very sharp right skew. This suggests that most countries have a relatively low population density, with very few countries having extremely high population densities.\nThe Q-Q plot for total cases per million deviates from the straight line, especially at the higher quantiles, which confirms the skew seen in the histogram. This indicates that the distribution of total cases per million is not normally distributed. The Q-Q plot for population density deviates significantly from the line across all quantiles, indicating that the distribution of population density is also not normal and is heavily skewed to the right.\nConsidering the non-normal distribution of your data, I want to use non-parametric tests, for instance, Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient Test.\n\n\nSpearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient Test and Result\nSpearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient is a non-parametric test that measures the strength and direction of the association between two ranked variables. Unlike Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Spearman’s does not assume that the data are normally distributed, making it more appropriate for ordinal data or continuous data that do not meet the assumptions of normality. The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis that were determined are listed below:\n\nH0: There is no monotonic relationship between ‘total cases per million’ and ‘population density’.\nH1: There is a monotonic relationship between ‘total cases(either increasing or decreasing, but not necessarily linear) per million’ and ‘population density’.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Perform Spearman's correlation test\nspearman_result &lt;- cor.test(owid_covid_data_country_clean$total_cases_per_million, owid_covid_data_country_clean$population_density, method = \"spearman\")\n\nprint(spearman_result)\n\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  owid_covid_data_country_clean$total_cases_per_million and owid_covid_data_country_clean$population_density\nS = 1127116, p-value = 3.943e-05\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n      rho \n0.2800833 \n\n\nThe result of the Spearman’s rank correlation test indicates a statistically significant association between the total cases per million and population density across different countries, as evidenced by the p-value of approximately 0.00003943. This p-value is much lower than the common alpha level of 0.05, suggesting that the observed correlation is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\nThe sample estimate of Spearman’s rho is 0.2800833, which denotes a positive correlation between the two variables. Although this value of rho suggests a positive association, it is not very strong. The coefficient indicates that as population density increases, the total cases per million tend to increase as well, albeit not in a perfectly linear fashion.\nGiven the alternative hypothesis that the true rho is not equal to zero, the test result supports the conclusion that there is a statistically significant but moderate positive correlation between population density and total COVID-19 cases per million. However, it is important to consider other factors that could also influence the number of reported COVID-19 cases and remember that correlation does not imply causation."

    "text": "Vaccination and the Infection/Death Rates of COVID-19\nThe analysis and visualizations previously presented reveal a notable decrease in daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States following the commencement of vaccinations. However, attributing this decline directly to the vaccine’s impact necessitates additional investigation. For the purpose of this study, I have postulated that the vaccine’s effects began to manifest subsequent to the initiation of the vaccination campaign on December 13, 2020. Accordingly, the data has been segregated into two distinct periods: pre-vaccination and post-vaccination, to be prepared for hypothesis testing. It is important to acknowledge that in reality, vaccines typically require a certain level of population coverage to effectively curb the spread of a virus. Nonetheless, for the sake of simplifying this analysis, I will proceed with the assumption that the vaccine began exerting its influence immediately after the vaccination program was launched.\n\nDecomposing\nAn important prerequisite for hypothesis testing in time series analysis, which sets it apart from cross-sectional data analysis, is the assessment of data stationarity. Stationarity implies that the time series’ statistical properties—such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation—remain constant over time. My prior analyses have indicated the presence of trends and seasonal fluctuations in the data pertaining to new cases and deaths. Consequently, I employed the decomposition method to transform the data, thereby stabilizing these temporal elements before proceeding further with hypothesis testing.\n\n\nCode\n# Plotting the decomposed components\nplot(decomposed_cases, main = \"Decomposition of Daily New COVID-19 Cases\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot(decomposed_deaths, main = \"Decomposition of Daily New COVID-19 Deaths\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Stationarity\n\n\nCode\n# ADF test on new cases\nadf_test_cases &lt;- adf.test(residual_cases, alternative = \"stationary\")\n\n# ADF test on new deaths\nadf_test_deaths &lt;- adf.test(residual_deaths, alternative = \"stationary\")\n\n# Output for new cases\nprint(adf_test_cases)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  residual_cases\nDickey-Fuller = -8.9859, Lag order = 12, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nCode\n# Output for new deaths\nprint(adf_test_deaths)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  residual_deaths\nDickey-Fuller = -3.1729, Lag order = 12, p-value = 0.09258\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Setting up the layout\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\n\n# ACF and PACF for new cases residuals\nacf(residual_cases, lag = 48, main=\"ACF for Residual Cases\")\npacf(residual_cases, lag = 48, main=\"PACF for Residual Cases\")\n\n# ACF and PACF for new deaths residuals\nacf(residual_deaths, lag = 48, main=\"ACF for Residual Deaths\")\npacf(residual_deaths, lag = 48, main=\"PACF for Residual Deaths\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACF for residual cases shows a significant drop-off after the first few lags, suggesting that any autocorrelation in the original series may have been removed, likely due to differencing or other transformations. The PACF for residual cases displays a sharp cut-off after the first lag, which typically suggests an AR(1) process could be a good model for the time series.\nThe ACF for residual deaths decreases gradually, which may indicate a slower decay in correlation and could suggest a higher order of AR process or a need for further differencing. The PACF for residual deaths also trails off, suggesting complexity in the data that might not be fully captured by a simple AR or MA model.\nFor residual cases, the ADF test statistic is -8.9859 with a p-value of 0.01. Since the p-value is less than the common significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of a unit root being present, indicating that the time series of residual cases is stationary.\nFor residual deaths, the ADF test statistic is -3.1729 with a p-value of 0.09258. This p-value is greater than 0.05, which means we fail to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root, indicating that the time series of residual deaths might not be stationary.\nThe analysis suggests that the residuals for cases are stationary and suitable for further analysis. However, the residuals for deaths may require further transformation to achieve stationarity, such as additional differencing.\n\n\nFirst-Differencing\n\n\nCode\n# First differencing for new deaths residuals\ndiff_deaths &lt;- diff(residual_deaths)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Setting up the layout\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\n# ACF and PACF for differenced new deaths residuals\nacf(diff_deaths, lag = 48, main=\"ACF for Differenced Residual Deaths\")\npacf(diff_deaths, lag = 48, main=\"PACF for Differenced Residual Deaths\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that the time-series after the 1st-differencing is more stationary and basically meets the conditions for hypothesis testing.\n\n\nDistribution\n\n\nCode\n# Assuming 'vaccine_start_date' is the date when vaccination started\nvaccine_start_date &lt;- as.Date(\"2020-12-13\")\n\n# Splitting the data\npre_vaccine_residual_cases &lt;- residual_cases[covid_data$date &lt; vaccine_start_date]\npost_vaccine_residual_cases &lt;- residual_cases[covid_data$date &gt;= vaccine_start_date]\n\npre_vaccine_diff_deaths &lt;- diff_deaths[covid_data$date &lt; vaccine_start_date]\npost_vaccine_diff_deaths &lt;- diff_deaths[covid_data$date &gt;= vaccine_start_date]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Setting up the layout\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\n\n# Plotting for new cases\nhist(pre_vaccine_residual_cases, main = \"Pre-Vaccine Residuals of New Cases\", xlab = \"Residual Cases\", col = \"blue\", breaks = 30)\nhist(post_vaccine_residual_cases, main = \"Post-Vaccine Residuals of New Cases\", xlab = \"Residual Cases\", col = \"red\", breaks = 30)\n\n# Plotting for new deaths\nhist(pre_vaccine_diff_deaths, main = \"Pre-Vaccine Differenced Residuals of New Deaths\", xlab = \"Differenced Residual Deaths\", col = \"blue\", breaks = 30)\nhist(post_vaccine_diff_deaths, main = \"Post-Vaccine Differenced Residuals of New Deaths\", xlab = \"Differenced Residual Deaths\", col = \"red\", breaks = 30)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the histogram, the residuals for new cases and new deaths do not fit the normal distribution, I can use a non-parametric test such as the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nMann-Whitney U test and Result\nThe Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric statistical test that is used to compare differences between two independent groups when the dependent variable is either ordinal or continuous, but not normally distributed. It does not assume normality of the residuals and is especially useful when dealing with skewed distributions or when you have outliers that could affect the results of a parametric test like the t-test. The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis that were determined are listed below:\n\nH0: There is no difference in the distribution of the differenced residuals of new COVID-19 cases before and after the vaccine rollout.\nH1: There is a difference in the distribution of the differenced residuals of new COVID-19 cases before and after the vaccine rollout.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Mann-Whitney U test for New Cases\nwilcox_test_cases &lt;- wilcox.test(pre_vaccine_residual_cases, post_vaccine_residual_cases)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(wilcox_test_cases)\n\n\n\n    Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  pre_vaccine_residual_cases and post_vaccine_residual_cases\nW = 433250, p-value = 3.388e-13\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Mann-Whitney U test for New Deaths\nwilcox_test_deaths &lt;- wilcox.test(pre_vaccine_diff_deaths, post_vaccine_diff_deaths)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(wilcox_test_deaths)\n\n\n\n    Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  pre_vaccine_diff_deaths and post_vaccine_diff_deaths\nW = 368090, p-value = 0.3612\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\nThe results suggest that the vaccine introduction had a statistically significant impact on the distribution of residual cases, which could reflect changes in trends or patterns of COVID-19 cases due to the effect of vaccination.\nIn contrast, the distribution of differenced deaths did not show a significant change before and after the vaccine introduction. This could mean that the vaccine’s impact on the patterns or trends of deaths was not as pronounced or detectable in the data, or that other confounding factors may have influenced the number of deaths."

    "text": "This research has yielded two notable findings regarding the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nFirstly, a significant variation in COVID-19 infection rates across countries has been observed, with a discernible positive correlation between these rates and the population density of a country. In essence, countries with higher population densities tend to exhibit increased COVID-19 infection rates. While this correlation does not establish causality, it underscores the potential mechanisms of virus transmission, emphasizing that measures such as reducing mass gatherings and maintaining social distancing could be effective in curtailing the spread of the virus.\nSecondly, the deployment of vaccines appears to have influenced the rise in COVID-19 cases, though the connection to mortality rates remains ambiguous. Again, while causality cannot be inferred from this correlation, the association suggests that vaccines play a role in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, providing humanity with a potent tool in combating the pandemic.\n\nThis investigation serves as an initial inquiry into the factors influencing COVID-19’s impact. The constraints of the data and the analytical methods used precluded a more detailed examination, such as employing time-series analysis to assess the specific effects of vaccination on the pandemic’s trajectory.\n\nCOVID-19 has wrought considerable havoc, disrupting our daily lives and leading to the loss of many. However, I am confident that through collective human effort, we will ultimately prevail over this pandemic and emerge better prepared for any future global health crises."
