## Face Mask Detection ~12K Images Dataset

The dataset used in our study is [Face Mask Detection ~12K Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset/data), which is used for Face Mask Detection Classification with images. The dataset consists of almost 12K images which are almost 328.92MB in size.

## Data Preprocessing

The data set is divided in training, testing and validation directories.

The dataset employed in this study comprises facial headshots, which inherently simplifies the analytical process by minimizing extraneous background distractions. Nevertheless, the images exhibit variability in pixel count and dimensions, necessitating their standardization to a uniform resolution of 150x150 pixels to ensure consistency in the data processing and analysis.
