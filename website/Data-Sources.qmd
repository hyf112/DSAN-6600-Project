## Our World in Data (OWID) COVID-19 Data 

The [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) dataset is an open and comprehensive resource for data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset provides extensive data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing, vaccinations, and various other metrics. It covers a global scope, with data from nearly every country in the world. The information is compiled from various reputable sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and numerous other national and international health agencies. The dataset is updated regularly, often daily, to provide the most current information available on the pandemic's status across the globe.
